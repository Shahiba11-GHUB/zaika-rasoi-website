Zaika Rasoi Website Assignment 4 Report

I made a 3-page restaurant website using simple code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It works on phones, tablets, and computers.

Pages:

Home Page - More graphcial thats Shows big food pictures with little text. Has icons for delivery/takeout.
Menu Page - A detailed products page that Lists all food with photos, descriptions, and prices in neat cards.
About Page - Tells the restaurant's story with one main photo.
All pages link to each other through a navigation menu.

1. Home Page (ZaikaRasoi.html)

Features a large hero image of Indian food (graphical focus)
Contains minimal text with just a welcome message
Shows key features through icons (delivery, takeout, recipes)

2. Menu Page- second page (Menu.html): Displays all menu items in a responsive grid, Clear name, Detailed description
price display Organized by food type (vegetarian/non-vegetarian).

3. About Page (About.html): Tells the restaurant's story

Responsive Design Implementation (Mobile Friendly): I followed mobile-first principles designing for mobile screens first, then adding enhancements for larger screens
Adding hamburger menu for mobile, Flexible grids that adapt to screen size, Everything resizes properly
Easy to read on any device

Technical Implementation
HTML for structure and i made proper linking between all pages
CSS for colors/layout and Mobile-first media queries.
JavaScript:I used basic mobile menu toggle

Design for visual display:
Maroon and gold colors
Big, clear photos
Simple fonts
